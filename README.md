# üé¨ Movie Recommender System üçø

Welcome to the Movie Recommender System! This Streamlit web application suggests movies to users based on their plot descriptions. It utilizes advanced techniques like TF-IDF and cosine similarity to provide accurate recommendations.

## Overview üìã

This recommendation system assists users in discovering new movies similar to those they have enjoyed. By analyzing the plot descriptions of movies, the system identifies similarities and suggests relevant recommendations.

## How It Works ü§î

### TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) üìä

TF-IDF is a numerical statistic that reflects the importance of a word in a document relative to a collection of documents. In the context of our recommendation system:
- **Term Frequency (TF)** measures how frequently a term (word) occurs in a movie's plot description.
- **Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)** measures how important a term is across all movie plot descriptions.
- **TF-IDF** is the product of TF and IDF, combining the local importance of a term in a movie's plot description with its global importance across all movies.

### Cosine Similarity üìê

Cosine similarity calculates the cosine of the angle between two vectors, giving a measure of similarity between them. In our recommendation system:
- We represent each movie's plot description as a TF-IDF vector.
- We calculate the cosine similarity between the TF-IDF vectors of different movies.
- Higher cosine similarity values indicate greater similarity between movies.

## Streamlit App üöÄ

The Streamlit app provides an intuitive interface for users to interact with the recommendation system:
- **Select Movie**: Users can choose a movie from the dropdown menu to view details about that movie.
- **Recommended Movies**: The app displays five recommended movies based on cosine similarity to the selected movie.
- **Interactive Interface**: Users can easily navigate through the app's interface and explore movie recommendations.

## Dataset üìä

The recommendation system is built upon a dataset containing information about thousands of movies, including their titles, genres, cast, crew, tags, and plot descriptions. The dataset used in this app can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gazu468/tmdb-10000-movies-dataset).

## Technologies Used üõ†Ô∏è

- **Streamlit**: For creating the interactive web application.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Pillow (PIL)**: For loading and displaying movie posters.
- **Python**: For backend logic and calculations.

## How to Run ‚ñ∂Ô∏è

To run the app locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/movierecommender.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd movierecommender
```
3. Run the Streamlit app:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
